        <h1>Dress Styles</h1>
        <p>Finding the perfect dress is all about discovering the style that makes you feel confident and beautiful.
            From classic silhouettes to modern trends, explore different wedding dress styles to inspire your dream
            look.</p>

        <h2>5 Most Popular Dress Styles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>A-Line Silhouette</strong> — The A-line gown remains a timeless favorite, known for its
                universally flattering shape that gently flares from the waist to the hem, resembling the letter "A."
                This silhouette offers a balance of comfort and elegance, making it suitable for various wedding themes
                and venues. Avery Austin</li>
            <li><strong>Mermaid & Trumpet Styles</strong> — These figure-hugging designs are celebrated for accentuating
                the body's natural curves. The mermaid style flares dramatically at or below the knee, while the trumpet
                offers a subtler flare. Both styles are ideal for brides seeking a glamorous, modern look. Stacees</li>
            <li><strong>Basque & Drop Waist</strong> — Inspired by 18th-century fashion, the basque waistline dips into
                a "V" shape at the center, creating a stunning and flattering silhouette. The drop waist sits a couple
                of inches lower than the natural waist, elongating the torso and offering a seamless, elegant look.

            <li><strong>Corset Bodices</strong> — Corset-style wedding dresses are making a comeback, offering
                structured support and a flattering fit. These dresses often feature lace-up backs and boning, providing
                both comfort and a touch of vintage allure. Bridal Atelier Montclair</li>
            <li><strong>Square Necklines</strong> — Square necklines are gaining popularity for their clean, modern
                aesthetic. They provide a structured look while highlighting the collarbones and shoulders, making them
                a favorite for minimalist brides.</li>
        </ol>

                    lightweight, breathable, and has a subtle stretch, making it comfortable for all-day wear. It's

                    for contemporary brides seeking a clean, sophisticated look.</li>
                <li><strong>Tulle</strong> — A sheer, lightweight netting that adds volume and texture to wedding
                    dresses.
                    Tulle is often used in layered skirts, veils, and overlays, creating a whimsical and ethereal
                    appearance. It's perfect for fairy-tale-inspired gowns and adds a touch of romance.</li>
                <li><strong>Lace</strong> — A delicate, intricate fabric that adds texture and depth to wedding dresses.
                    Lace comes in various styles, including Chantilly, Alençon, and Guipure, each offering unique
                    patterns
                    and designs. It's often used for sleeves, bodices, and overlays, providing a vintage or bohemian
                    flair.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Organza</strong> — A crisp, sheer fabric that adds structure and volume without weight.

                    lightweight
                    nature makes it suitable for warm-weather weddings while still providing a formal appearance.</li>
